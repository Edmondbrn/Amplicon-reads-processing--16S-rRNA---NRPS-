# Downstream analysis

This part is dedicated to the study of the alpha and betas diversity for 16S rRNA and NRPS datasets.

- 16S rRNA: You will find the rarefaction process, the plot for alpha diversity and the PCoA plot for the beta diversity. Moreover, you will alos get some information about descriptive statistics from raw reads.

- NRPS: That's the same, but you will also get some heatmaps about the most abundant clusters in the different samples and the percentages of annotated clusters. A venn diagram is plot at the end to study the common and unique clusters according to the irrigation status at week 4 and 5. Finally, a python3 script is available to extract the sequences of clusters which are present in the heatmap (heatmap function generated a table which python can read).
